Lecture notes from the postgraduate course STAT5010, given by professor
Tony SIT at the Department of Statistics at CUHK in the academic year 2022-23. This
course covers \textit{Point Estimation} and \textit{Hypothesis Testing} mainly. 
Credit for the material in these notes is due to professor
SIT, while the structure is loosely taken from the professor released handwriting notes. 
The credit for the typesetting is my own.

\textit{Disclaimer:} This document will inevitably contain some mistakes â€” both
simple typos and legitimate errors. Keep in mind that these are the notes of an
postgraduate student in the process of learning the material himself, so take
what you read with a grain of salt. If you find mistakes and feel like telling
me, I will be grateful and happy to hear from you, even for the most trivial of
errors. You can reach me by email, in English or Chinese, at
